* strain state
   synced to the hitstack, needs to be updated incrementally whenever
   possible
* slip-back
   to allow slip-flipping needed for search control
* flipstack
   maintained optionally, stores flip-lists corresponding to slipstack
   entries
* credits
   clean up side/backtracking credit, implement forward credit, document
   both
* first-verge, next-verge
   these should return verge-state, but keep plain verge returning
   just the hitstack
* verge hierarchies
   defining slip as inner verge
