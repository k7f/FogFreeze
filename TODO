* stateful strains
   document them
* first-verge, next-verge
   these should return verge-state (but plain verge should still return
   just the hitstack)
* slip-back
   to allow slip-flipping needed for search control
* flipstack
   maintained optionally, stores flip-lists corresponding to slipstack
   entries
* credits
   clean up side/backtracking credit, implement forward credit, document
   both
* verge hierarchies
   defining slip as inner verge
